  

## Status

  

Accepted

## Context

  

InTouch supports multiple authentication methods, including:

  

- Email & Password

- Google OAuth

  

A user may authenticate using different methods over time while maintaining a single account.

  

The system must prevent duplicate accounts that share the same email address.

  

---

  

## Decision

  

Email is globally unique across the system.

  

Only one user account may exist for a given email address.

  

Authentication methods are linked to the existing account instead of creating duplicate users.

  

For the MVP, OAuth provider information will be stored directly on the `User` document.

  

Provider credentials are embedded in the `loginProviders` array. Each provider

entry stores its provider type, provider account ID, link time, last-use time,

and provider-specific credential data when required.

  

For Google, `providerAccountId` stores the stable Google `sub` claim. The pair

of provider type and provider account ID is uniquely indexed across users.

  

Future OAuth providers (GitHub, Microsoft, etc.) may introduce additional provider fields or be migrated to a dedicated OAuthAccount collection if the authentication system grows in complexity.

## Authentication Rules

  

### Local Registration

  

If the email does not exist:

  

- Create a new user.

- Store the password hash.

  

If the email already exists:

  

- Reject the registration.

  

---

  

### Google Sign-In

  

If no user exists with the Google email:

  

- Create a new user.

- Store the Google Provider ID.

- Leave `passwordHash` empty.

  

If a user already exists with the same email:

  

- Link the Google Provider ID to the existing account.

- Do not create a second user.

  

---

  

### Local Login

  

Users authenticate using:

  

- Email

- Password

  

Password verification is skipped for Google-only accounts.

  

---

  

### Google Login

  

Users authenticate through Google OAuth.

  

After Google verifies the user's identity:

  

- Find the user by the Google `sub` provider ID first.

- If the provider is not linked, find the user by verified email.

- Link the provider if necessary.

- Refresh the stored Google avatar fallback when Google supplies a picture.

- Preserve the existing fallback when Google omits the picture claim.

- Authenticate the existing account.

  

Uploaded R2 avatars remain authoritative in the UI. Google avatar

synchronization updates only the external fallback used when no uploaded avatar

is selected.

## Edge Cases

  

### Existing Google Account → Local Password

  

A user who originally registered with Google may later choose to add a password.

  

This action requires ownership verification (for example, authenticating with Google before setting a password).

  

---

  

### Existing Local Account → Google Login

  

If Google returns the same email address as an existing local account:

  

- Link the Google Provider ID.

- Reuse the existing account.

- Preserve all organizations, memberships, conversations, and data.

  

---

  

### Duplicate Emails

  

Duplicate accounts with the same email are never permitted.

  

The email address is treated as the unique identity of a user.

## Alternatives Considered

  

### Separate OAuthAccount Collection

  

Pros

  

- Supports unlimited authentication providers.

- Cleaner normalization.

- Easier provider management.

  

Cons

  

- Additional collection.

- More joins (or multiple queries).

- Unnecessary complexity for the MVP.

  

This option may be revisited in a future version of InTouch.

## Consequences

  

### Advantages

  

- Prevents duplicate accounts.

- Simplifies authentication.

- Keeps user data centralized.

- Easy to extend in the future.

  

### Trade-offs

  

- The User document contains provider-specific fields.

- A dedicated OAuthAccount collection may eventually provide a cleaner design if many providers are supported.
