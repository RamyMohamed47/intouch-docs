# InTouch Mobile V2.0

  

Mobile V2.0 adds Android-first LiveKit media to the existing online-first Expo

client. InTouch remains authoritative for identity, authorization, call state,

voice-channel occupancy, moderation, and call history. LiveKit carries media

and WebRTC signaling only.

  

## Capabilities

  

- Public and private voice channels support up to ten participants.

- Direct messages support `AUDIO` and `VIDEO` calls with ringing, accept,

  decline, cancel, missed, timeout, active, and completed states.

- A user has at most one active voice session. Switching requires explicit

  confirmation and uses the API's atomic Redis-backed transfer path.

- Microphone, deafen, camera, audio-output, connection, participant-speaking,

  and leave controls are available in calls and voice channels.

- Screen shares can be viewed fullscreen. Android can publish screen video

  while microphone audio continues; device audio is not captured. iOS can view

  shares but cannot publish them in this release.

- Organization owners can server-mute or disconnect voice-channel participants

  and stop a participant's active screen share. Remote unmute is prohibited.

- Direct calls retain their immutable `CALL` timeline entry and duration. Call

  interruption does not add a second durable notification record.

  

## Runtime Architecture

  

`VoiceProvider` owns one navigation-persistent LiveKit `Room`, native audio

session, local microphone/camera/share tracks, ringing tones, active API session,

and reconnect state. TanStack Query remains authoritative for durable call and

conversation data. Socket.IO carries call state, occupancy, moderation, and

voice-heartbeat events, never media or provider credentials.

  

Android starts a low-importance foreground service before connecting media and

stops it after leaving. Active audio and the Socket.IO voice heartbeat continue

while the app is backgrounded. The camera is disabled as soon as the app leaves

the foreground and remains off until the user enables it again. Screen-share

publishing uses LiveKit's Android media-projection service and is not resumed

automatically after process death.

  

Provider webhooks and periodic reconciliation remain authoritative when mobile

events are delayed or lost. Reconciliation refreshes the Redis lease for a

participant who is still present in LiveKit, preventing a healthy backgrounded

mobile audio session from expiring solely because JavaScript timers were

suspended.

  

## Call Notifications

  

Incoming calls use a short-lived `CallAlertOutbox` record and the

`call-alert-delivery` BullMQ queue. Delivery occurs only while the call remains

`RINGING`, checks the recipient's Calls preference and active organization or

conversation mutes immediately before dispatch, and expires with the 30-second

ringing window.

  

Android uses the `intouch-calls-v2` high-priority notification channel and the

bundled InTouch call tone. A data-only state update asks the client to dismiss a

stale ringing notification. Opening an alert always fetches current call state,

so delayed or already-ended alerts cannot resurrect a call. No caller name,

email, message text, provider room ID, token, or media credential is included in

the push data payload.

  

The implementation deliberately does not use iOS CallKit, Android Telecom,

full-screen intents, or actionable accept/decline notification buttons. Push

opens the normal InTouch incoming-call screen.

  

## Configuration

  

Mobile introduces no new public runtime variable. The API continues to own the

existing LiveKit configuration:

  

```dotenv

VOICE_PROVIDER=livekit

LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud

LIVEKIT_API_KEY=replace-with-server-key

LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=replace-with-server-secret

```

  

Call push delivery reuses the existing Expo configuration:

  

```dotenv

PUSH_PROVIDER=expo

EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN=replace-with-expo-access-token

PUSH_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=replace-with-independent-32-byte-secret

```

  

EAS still requires `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` and configured FCM V1 credentials for

Android push. No additional Firebase, Redis, R2, Railway, or LiveKit credential

is required.

  

## Native Build Requirement

  

This release adds native LiveKit, WebRTC, audio, TaskManager, and Android

foreground-service configuration. Create and install fresh development and

preview APKs. An OTA update or `npm run dev:mobile` cannot retrofit these native

modules into an older binary.

  

```powershell

cd apps/mobile

npx eas-cli@latest build --platform android --profile development

npx eas-cli@latest build --platform android --profile preview

```

  

## Manual Acceptance

  

1. Install the rebuilt Android development APK on two physical devices and run

   both against the same local API and LiveKit project.

2. Join public and private voice channels, verify occupancy updates without a

   refresh, enforce ten-person capacity, and confirm unauthorized members cannot

   join private rooms.

3. Switch between two voice sessions and verify the confirmation appears, the

   previous room disconnects, and Redis reports only one active session.

4. Start audio and video DM calls. Verify ringing, ringback, accept, decline,

   cancel, missed timeout, busy response, connection timeout, duration, and the

   immutable timeline entry.

5. Deny camera permission on a video call and verify the call continues with

   audio and camera off. Background an active video call and verify audio stays

   connected while camera remains off after foregrounding.

6. Toggle microphone, deafen, camera, speaker/earpiece/headset/Bluetooth output,

   and reconnect after a short network interruption.

7. Publish camera and screen video concurrently on Android. Verify microphone

   audio continues, device audio is absent, another participant can view the

   share fullscreen, and stopping the share leaves the call connected.

8. As an owner, mute and disconnect another voice-channel participant and stop

   their screen share. Verify a member cannot invoke those actions and nobody

   can remotely unmute another participant.

9. Background the recipient app and start a direct call. Verify the call alert

   opens the correct screen, uses the bundled tone, and disappears after accept,

   decline, cancel, or timeout when background execution permits.

10. Disable Calls, then test one-hour and permanent workspace/conversation

    mutes. Verify call push and foreground interruption are suppressed while the

    call timeline and normal realtime cache reconciliation remain intact.

11. Kill and reopen the app during an active session. Verify the API/provider

    either resumes an authorized active lease or presents a clean ended state;

    screen share and camera do not resume automatically.

12. Repeat the critical call, background-audio, push, and share tests against the

    Railway API using a preview APK.

  

## Deferred

  

- iOS runtime acceptance, CallKit, Android Telecom, full-screen call intents,

  lock-screen accept/decline actions, and offline VoIP wake guarantees.

- Screen-share device audio, mobile recording, transcription, SIP, E2EE,

  background camera, and automatic screen-share restoration.

- Multiple simultaneous sessions, group DM calls, per-contact ringtones, and

  persistent local call or media state.
