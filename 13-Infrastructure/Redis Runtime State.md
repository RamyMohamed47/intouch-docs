# Redis Runtime State

  

Production uses Redis for ephemeral coordination between API replicas. MongoDB

remains the durable source of truth.

  

## Redis Owns

  

- Socket.IO Pub/Sub adapter traffic and cross-replica room broadcasts.

- Presence socket leases, active-user expiry, and offline-transition claims.

- Typing socket leases and expiry claims.

- Authenticated per-user token buckets.

- Active Socket.IO connection limits.

- Public authentication endpoint IP limit windows.

- BullMQ scheduling and delivery state for transactional mail and private-asset

  cleanup. Queue payloads contain opaque MongoDB IDs only.

  

Redis does not become the durable source of truth for refresh sessions,

login-attempt records, notifications, mail outbox records, uploads, messages,

memberships, or read receipts. MongoDB reconcilers can recreate BullMQ work.

  

## Runtime Policies

  

- Socket and presence leases renew every 15 seconds and expire after 45 seconds.

- A normal final disconnect and an expired lease both use the five-second

  presence offline grace period.

- Typing clients refresh every three seconds and typing expires after five

  seconds.

- Expired presence and typing transitions are claimed atomically by one API

  replica before final events are broadcast.

- Existing authenticated rate-limit capacities and refill policies are shared

  across replicas without changing their public responses.

  

## Configuration

  

Local development defaults to `RUNTIME_STATE_PROVIDER=memory`. Redis can be

started locally with `npm run redis:up` and stopped with `npm run redis:down`.

  

Production requires:

  

```dotenv

RUNTIME_STATE_PROVIDER=redis

REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@private-host:6379

REDIS_KEY_PREFIX=intouch:production:v2

BACKGROUND_JOBS_PROVIDER=bullmq

```

  

Every replica in one environment must share the URL and key prefix. Separate

environments must use separate prefixes.

  

BullMQ keys use the `${REDIS_KEY_PREFIX}:bullmq` namespace. Redis must use the

`noeviction` max-memory policy. Workers run in each API replica with shared

global concurrency, and MongoDB remains authoritative for outbox and asset

lifecycle state. Local memory mode defaults to

`BACKGROUND_JOBS_PROVIDER=polling`; BullMQ cannot be selected without Redis.

  

## Failure Behavior

  

The API does not fall back from Redis to memory in production. Startup fails if

Redis cannot be reached. After startup, `/health` remains a process-liveness

check while `/ready` returns `503` if MongoDB, Redis, or the selected background

job runtime is unavailable.

Protected runtime operations fail closed. Socket connection middleware returns

`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`; the web client retries without rotating authentication

tokens.

  

The standard Socket.IO Redis adapter uses Pub/Sub and does not replay events

missed while a client or replica is disconnected. Durable state is reconciled

from MongoDB after reconnects.
