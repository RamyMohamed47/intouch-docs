# Background Jobs

InTouch uses BullMQ when `BACKGROUND_JOBS_PROVIDER=bullmq` and the original
leased MongoDB pollers when `BACKGROUND_JOBS_PROVIDER=polling`. Production and
the standard Docker-backed local workflow use BullMQ. Polling remains the
local-memory fallback and emergency rollback path.

## Ownership

- MongoDB `MailOutbox` records own durable mail state and encrypted payloads.
- MongoDB `StoredAsset` records own durable R2 lifecycle and cleanup state.
- MongoDB `PushOutbox` records own durable mobile notification delivery and
  Expo receipt state.
- MongoDB `CallAlertOutbox` records own short-lived direct-call interruption
  and stale-ringing cancellation state.
- BullMQ owns dispatch, retry timing, shared concurrency, and short-lived job
  history only.
- In-app notifications remain transactional MongoDB writes. Their opaque IDs
  are reconciled into the push outbox after commit.

Redis payloads contain only opaque MongoDB IDs, cleanup mode, and an integer
attempt version. They never contain recipients, tokens, filenames, object keys,
presigned URLs, or email bodies.

## Queues

All keys are under `${REDIS_KEY_PREFIX}:bullmq`.

- `mail-delivery`: reconciles every two seconds, global concurrency 5, global
  rate limit 10 jobs/second, and preserves mail delays of 30 seconds, 2 minutes,
  5 minutes, and 10 minutes across at most five delivery attempts.
- `asset-cleanup`: reconciles every five seconds in batches of 20, global
  concurrency 5, and performs three BullMQ retries with exponential delay before
  returning the asset to MongoDB's bounded cleanup backoff. Abandoned or
  unclaimed voice-note uploads use this existing lifecycle; voice notes add no
  queue or job payload.
- `voice-lifecycle`: processes ringing, accepted-media, and disconnect-grace
  timeouts and runs a repeatable reconciliation job every 30 seconds. Every
  transition is idempotent so duplicate, delayed, or out-of-order jobs are safe.
- `push-delivery`: reconciles every two seconds, sends safe activity-only copy
  through Expo Push Service, and checks provider receipts after 15 minutes.
  Tokens are encrypted in MongoDB and never enter BullMQ payloads. Category
  preferences and active workspace/conversation mutes are checked immediately
  before dispatch; suppressed jobs complete successfully without calling Expo.
- `call-alert-delivery`: reconciles every second with concurrency 5, delivers a
  high-priority incoming-call interruption during the 30-second ringing window,
  and follows it with a data-only stale-ringing cancellation signal. The calls
  preference and active workspace/conversation mutes are evaluated immediately
  before dispatch. Four bounded attempts use 1, 3, and 7 second retry delays.

Every mutation remains idempotent through repository-level leases and status
conditions. Reconciliation recovers committed MongoDB work after API crashes,
Redis restarts, or enqueue gaps. Queue failures never roll back an already
committed domain mutation.

## Lifecycle

API startup connects MongoDB and waits for queue and worker readiness before
listening. `/ready` requires MongoDB, Redis runtime state, and the background-job
runtime. Graceful shutdown stops Socket.IO and HTTP admission, drains workers,
closes queues and the mail transport, then closes Redis and MongoDB.

Workers run inside every API replica. BullMQ global limits keep aggregate
throughput bounded as replicas scale. Redis must use `noeviction`. There is no
public queue endpoint or Bull Board deployment; structured logs are the current
operational interface.

For local development, `npm run infra:up` starts Redis with the required policy
and Mailpit for SMTP capture. Set `MAIL_PROVIDER=smtp`, `SMTP_HOST=localhost`,
`SMTP_PORT=1025`, and disable TLS. Inspect captured jobs at
`http://localhost:8025`. See
`.agents/infrastructure/Local Docker Infrastructure.md` for the complete local
configuration.
