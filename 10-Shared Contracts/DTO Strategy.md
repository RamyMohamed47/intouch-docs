  

# DTO Strategy

  

## Purpose

  

DTOs define data crossing an external application boundary. They are not

domain models, Mongoose documents, repository records, or service dependency

interfaces.

  

The shared `@intouch/shared` workspace is the source of truth for DTO schemas

used by the API, web application, and future mobile clients.

  

## Covered Boundaries

  

Every externally visible payload must originate from a Zod schema:

  

- REST request bodies, path parameters, and query parameters.

- REST success and error responses.

- Socket.IO handshake authentication and client event payloads.

- Socket.IO acknowledgements and server event payloads.

  

Types are always inferred from their schema:

  

```ts

export type MessageDto = z.infer<typeof messageDtoSchema>;

```

  

Do not maintain a handwritten interface that duplicates an external payload.

  

## Internal Types

  

Internal domain and persistence types remain ordinary TypeScript types when

runtime boundary validation provides no value. This includes:

  

- Mongoose document shapes.

- Repository records and mutation inputs.

- Unit-of-work and policy interfaces.

- Service dependencies and internal provider/token structures.

  

Internal records must not be returned directly. A controller or transport

adapter parses them through the relevant response schema first. Parsing both

serializes values such as `Date` to JSON-safe strings and strips fields that

are not part of the public contract.

  

## Placement

  

- Reusable contracts live under `packages/shared/<domain>`.

- API-only path/query schemas may live beside their API route.

- Feature schemas export both the runtime schema and its inferred type.

- Response envelopes are schemas, not controller-local object types.

  

## OpenAPI

  

OpenAPI 3.1 documents the same public shapes. Updating a DTO requires updating

its shared schema, contract tests, and the corresponding OpenAPI component in

the same change. OpenAPI must never be treated as an independent competing

type source.

  

## Enforcement

  

- Validate and normalize inbound DTOs before invoking a controller action.

- Parse outbound REST values before calling `res.json`.

- Parse outbound Socket.IO values before emitting them.

- Add contract tests for normalization, date serialization, field stripping,

  and strict input rejection.

- Never expose domain models, persistence-only fields, credentials, hashes, or

  provider metadata through a DTO.
