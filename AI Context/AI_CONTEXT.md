# InTouch AI Context

  

## Project Overview

  

- What is InTouch?

- Product vision

- MVP scope

  

## Technology Stack

  

- Node

- Express

- TypeScript

- MongoDB

- Socket.IO

- Zod

- Railway

  

## Architecture

  

- Layered Architecture

- Repository Pattern

- Feature Modules

- npm workspaces with applications under `apps` and contracts under `packages`

- Backend composition root at `apps/api/src/server.ts`

- Next.js frontend at `apps/web`

- Expo Router mobile application at `apps/mobile`, Android-first and iOS-ready

- Local application processes run natively; `compose.infrastructure.yml`

  provides the MongoDB replica set, Redis/BullMQ, and Mailpit development stack.

- Observability uses structured Railway logs, OpenTelemetry OTLP metrics and

  sampled traces, and sanitized Sentry error reporting. Local Grafana LGTM is

  optional and disposable; telemetry never controls application readiness.

  

## Engineering Principles

  

- Thin controllers

- Thin socket handlers

- Services own business logic

- Repository owns persistence

- Validation at boundaries

- Shared Zod contracts

- Contract-first

  

## Authentication

  

- Email/password auth is backend-owned.

- Access tokens are 15-minute HS256 Bearer JWTs.

- Refresh tokens are rotating opaque credentials stored only in HttpOnly cookies.

- MongoDB stores only refresh-token hashes in `AuthSession` documents.

- Production browser traffic reaches Railway through the frontend's same-origin API proxy.

- Refresh requests require an allowlisted Origin and `X-CSRF-Protection: 1`.

- Shared request contracts are exported by the `@intouch/shared` workspace.

- Password registration creates a pending account and a single-use email

  confirmation token; no session is issued until confirmation and login.

- Password reset uses a single-use action token and revokes every refresh

  session after the password changes.

- Mail delivery is decoupled through an encrypted MongoDB outbox with bounded

  retries. Production BullMQ jobs contain opaque outbox IDs and are reconciled

  from MongoDB; polling remains the local fallback. Brevo HTTPS supports

  restricted cloud hosts, while SMTP remains a local/VPS option. Organization

  invitations are emailed to verified users.

- Google sign-in uses a backend-owned authorization-code redirect flow.

- Google identities are keyed by the verified ID-token `sub` claim and linked

  to existing users only through verified email addresses.

- Google tokens are discarded after verification; InTouch continues to own JWT

  access tokens and rotating refresh sessions.

- Native mobile authentication returns access and refresh tokens through strict

  JSON endpoints. Access tokens remain in memory and rotating refresh tokens

  are stored in Expo SecureStore; browser cookie and CSRF behavior is unchanged.

  

## Mobile

  

- Expo SDK 57 and React Native 0.86 share `@intouch/shared` contracts with the

  API and web application.

- Mobile includes native authentication, workspace administration, text

  channels and DMs, attachments, reactions, typing, presence, receipts,

  themes, and chat wallpapers.

- TanStack Query owns API state. Socket.IO updates or reconciles those caches

  and disconnects while the app is backgrounded.

- V1.2 adds Echo streaming and composer tools, organization-wide search,

  message replies and mentions, notification categories and scoped mutes,

  authoritative badges, and sanitized mobile Sentry reporting.

- Mobile V2.0 adds LiveKit voice channels, direct audio/video calls, Android

  screen-share publishing, cross-platform screen-share viewing, call tones,

  foreground media controls, and high-priority Expo call notifications.

- Active audio sessions keep Socket.IO and the Android foreground service alive

  while backgrounded. Cameras stop on background and do not resume without a

  user action. Persistent offline data and queued sends remain out of scope.

  

## Multi-tenancy

  

Single Database + organizationId

  

## Notifications

  

- MongoDB stores durable, recipient-specific in-app notifications.

- Supported activity is invitation received, invitation accepted, incoming

  direct message, channel mention, channel reply, and reaction to the

  recipient's message.

- Notification writes and lifecycle cleanup share the source domain

  transaction; recipient-only Socket.IO events publish after commit.

- Unread DMs group per conversation until the recipient's read state advances.

- Notification records expire after 30 days. Mobile push tokens are encrypted

  at rest, scoped to installation IDs, delivered through a durable BullMQ-backed

  outbox, and removed when Expo reports `DeviceNotRegistered`.

- Category preferences and timed/permanent workspace or conversation mutes

  suppress push and foreground interruption only. Durable records, unread chat

  state, and Socket.IO reconciliation remain authoritative.

- Direct-call alerts are intentionally not durable inbox records. A short-lived

  MongoDB outbox and BullMQ queue deliver ringing state and a data-only stale

  alert cancellation after checking the calls preference and active mutes.

  

## Private Assets

  

- Profile avatars, organization logos, and message attachments are stored in a

  private Cloudflare R2 bucket; MongoDB stores ownership and lifecycle metadata

  only.

- Browsers upload with short-lived presigned `PUT` URLs. The API verifies file

  signatures before conditional promotion and authorizes every short-lived

  read URL.

- Message creation, avatar replacement, and organization-logo assignment claim

  completed uploads inside MongoDB transactions. Asynchronous cleanup removes

  canceled, abandoned, replaced, and deleted objects through BullMQ in

  production or leased polling locally.

- Public DTOs and Socket.IO events expose opaque asset IDs and safe metadata,

  never bucket keys, credentials, ETags, or presigned URLs.

  

## Voice Communication

  

- LiveKit Cloud carries audio, camera video, screen video/audio, and WebRTC

  signaling. InTouch remains authoritative for membership, call lifecycle,

  occupancy, history, and moderation.

- Voice channels are persistent `VOICE` conversations with a capacity of ten;

  existing channels are migrated to `TEXT`.

- Direct-message calls create immutable `CALL` timeline messages and use

  BullMQ for ringing, connection, disconnect-grace, and reconciliation jobs.

- Direct calls persist their initial `AUDIO | VIDEO` mode. Cameras are

  participant-controlled ephemeral tracks and remain optional in voice channels.

- Screen shares are participant-controlled ephemeral LiveKit tracks available in

  calls and voice channels. Multiple participants may present, compatible

  browser audio is optional, and owners can stop a current voice-channel share.

- Direct-call ringing uses original bundled InTouch audio: recipients hear the

  incoming chime and callers hear a quieter ringback. These UI tones are

  independent from LiveKit participant audio and never play in voice channels.

- Redis enforces one active voice session per user across API replicas and

  stores only opaque participant identities and ephemeral leases.

- Socket.IO carries call lifecycle, occupancy, and targeted moderation requests

  only. It never carries media, provider credentials, or WebRTC signaling.

- Mobile consumes the same credentials and lifecycle APIs as web. Android can

  publish screen video without device audio; iOS is receive-only for screen

  sharing in this release. Native CallKit and Android Telecom integration are

  deferred.

  

## Echo AI Assistant

  

- Echo uses Gemini through a provider interface. The API owns provider

  credentials, authorization, retrieval, redaction, quotas, and SSE streaming.

- Organization owners explicitly enable AI for a disclosure version; each

  member separately accepts or revokes consent.

- Conversation requests reuse normal access checks. Organization-wide retrieval

  searches only accessible public text channels and never broadens permissions.

- Composer transformations send only the caller's draft. Generated text is

  previewed and never sent automatically.

- Prompts, generated responses, and workspace excerpts are not persisted or

  logged. MongoDB stores only enablement and consent records.

- Redis coordinates bounded daily and concurrent usage across replicas. BullMQ

  is intentionally not involved in interactive AI generation.
