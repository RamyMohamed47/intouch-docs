# InTouch AI Context

  

## Project Overview

  

- What is InTouch?

- Product vision

- MVP scope

  

## Technology Stack

  

- Node

- Express

- TypeScript

- MongoDB

- Socket.IO

- Zod

- Railway

  

## Architecture

  

- Layered Architecture

- Repository Pattern

- Feature Modules

- npm workspaces with applications under `apps` and contracts under `packages`

- Backend composition root at `apps/api/src/server.ts`

- Next.js frontend at `apps/web`

- Future mobile application reserved for `apps/mobile`

  

## Engineering Principles

  

- Thin controllers

- Thin socket handlers

- Services own business logic

- Repository owns persistence

- Validation at boundaries

- Shared Zod contracts

- Contract-first

  

## Authentication

  

- Email/password auth is backend-owned.

- Access tokens are 15-minute HS256 Bearer JWTs.

- Refresh tokens are rotating opaque credentials stored only in HttpOnly cookies.

- MongoDB stores only refresh-token hashes in `AuthSession` documents.

- Production browser traffic reaches Railway through the frontend's same-origin API proxy.

- Refresh requests require an allowlisted Origin and `X-CSRF-Protection: 1`.

- Shared request contracts are exported by the `@intouch/shared` workspace.

- Password registration creates a pending account and a single-use email

  confirmation token; no session is issued until confirmation and login.

- Password reset uses a single-use action token and revokes every refresh

  session after the password changes.

- Mail delivery is decoupled through an encrypted MongoDB outbox with bounded

  retries. Production BullMQ jobs contain opaque outbox IDs and are reconciled

  from MongoDB; polling remains the local fallback. Brevo HTTPS supports

  restricted cloud hosts, while SMTP remains a local/VPS option. Organization

  invitations are emailed to verified users.

- Google sign-in uses a backend-owned authorization-code redirect flow.

- Google identities are keyed by the verified ID-token `sub` claim and linked

  to existing users only through verified email addresses.

- Google tokens are discarded after verification; InTouch continues to own JWT

  access tokens and rotating refresh sessions.

  

## Multi-tenancy

  

Single Database + organizationId

  

## Notifications

  

- MongoDB stores durable, recipient-specific in-app notifications.

- Supported activity is invitation received, invitation accepted, incoming

  direct message, and reaction to the recipient's message.

- Notification writes and lifecycle cleanup share the source domain

  transaction; recipient-only Socket.IO events publish after commit.

- Unread DMs group per conversation until the recipient's read state advances.

- Notification records expire after 30 days. Email and push preferences remain

  out of scope.

  

## Private Assets

  

- Profile avatars, organization logos, and message attachments are stored in a

  private Cloudflare R2 bucket; MongoDB stores ownership and lifecycle metadata

  only.

- Browsers upload with short-lived presigned `PUT` URLs. The API verifies file

  signatures before conditional promotion and authorizes every short-lived

  read URL.

- Message creation, avatar replacement, and organization-logo assignment claim

  completed uploads inside MongoDB transactions. Asynchronous cleanup removes

  canceled, abandoned, replaced, and deleted objects through BullMQ in

  production or leased polling locally.

- Public DTOs and Socket.IO events expose opaque asset IDs and safe metadata,

  never bucket keys, credentials, ETags, or presigned URLs.
